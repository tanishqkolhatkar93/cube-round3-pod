# Cube Buildathon · Round 3 · Pod Integration Build

**Commerce Context stream · Round 3 · Pod build**

> Five agents, one unit, one record that follows it. In Round 3 your Pod connects the five Round 2 agents into **one commerce system**.

**New here? Read [`START-HERE.md`](START-HERE.md) first.** This README is the concise overview; the detailed rules live in the guides.

## Objective

Integrate the five independently built Round 2 agents into one connected, end-to-end commerce workflow, and show it working. **Integrate → Orchestrate → Test → Deploy → Demonstrate.** Not a rebuild.

## What the Pod builds

```text
Receiving → Prep → Pack → Returns → Recovery → Final Commerce Outcome
```

| Member | Agent | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Receiving Manager | `agents/receiving/` |
| 2 | Prep Manager | `agents/prep/` |
| 3 | Pack Manager | `agents/pack/` |
| 4 | Returns Manager | `agents/returns/` |
| 5 | Recovery Manager | `agents/recovery/` |

Each member owns one agent. The Pod jointly owns the orchestration, shared contracts, workflow state, integration, end-to-end testing, documentation, demo and submission. **No participant owns the final system alone.**

## Architecture in one picture

```text
              ┌────────────────────────── Orchestrator (owns workflow state) ───────────────────────────┐
 case ──────▶ │ route · pass previous evidence · validate · record evidence · retry · UNCERTAIN · outcome │ ──▶ Workflow State
              └────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────┘      + Final Outcome
        Agent Input ▼         │         │         │         │  ▲ Agent Output (result + Evidence Record)
              Receiving     Prep      Pack     Returns   Recovery     ← each: in-process handle()  OR  HTTP /health + /run
```

- **One contract.** Every agent takes an *Agent Input* and returns an *Agent Output* containing an *Evidence Record*: per-check verdicts (PASS / FAIL / **UNCERTAIN**), confidence, model/version, timestamps, hashes.
- **One owner of state.** The orchestrator derives workflow status and the final outcome from the evidence chain. Agent outputs inform; they do not set state.
- **Failures are recorded, never hidden,** and never become success.

Details: [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [`INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`](INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) · [`ORCHESTRATION-GUIDE.md`](ORCHESTRATION-GUIDE.md).

## Quick setup and how to run

Requires Python 3.11+.

```sh
make setup            # venv + dependencies + .env
make test             # integration, end-to-end, failure, UNCERTAIN, override and HTTP tests
make run              # all sample workflows end to end -> out/workflows/*.json and out/evidence/*.json
make case UNIT=UNIT-0014 ORG=org_demo_alpha     # one workflow, in full
make serve            # orchestrator API on :8100 (POST /workflows, GET /workflows/{id}, GET /health)
```

The standard `Test` integration contains all five agent managers. Agent registrations and state directories are trusted server-side configuration; the real adapters do not silently fall back to synthetic CSV judgments. See each `agents/<stage>/README.md` before running a workflow.

## Operations console

Set unique values for `ORG_ALPHA_TOKEN` and `ORG_BRAVO_TOKEN` in your untracked `.env`, then run `make serve` (or, on Windows, `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn orchestration.api:app --port 8100 --env-file .env`) and open [http://localhost:8100](http://localhost:8100). The browser console supports tenant sign-in, workflow creation, stage/evidence review, resume, and human overrides across the full configured flow. The orchestrator exchanges the tenant token for an eight-hour HttpOnly, same-site cookie; the token is not stored in browser script storage. Recent workflow IDs are kept separately in the current browser for each tenant.

The console uses the existing tenant-scoped workflow API; tenant tokens are loaded only into the server process and compared server-side. Sign-in creates a random opaque server-side session; the tenant token itself is never sent back to the browser. Sessions expire after eight hours and are process-local, so a service restart signs users out and multi-worker deployments need a shared session store. The recorded actor is the shared tenant-token operator, not a verified individual identity. Do not commit `.env` or expose this local/demo service publicly without TLS, strong unique secrets, and deployment-grade authentication and authorization. Each agent still requires its own trusted registration and state configuration described in that agent's README; the UI does not configure agent providers, captures, or credentials.

The frontend is vanilla JavaScript served by FastAPI on the same origin. No React
server or separate API base URL is required. For frontend validation (Node 22.12+
or a compatible Vite-supported version):

```sh
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run build
```

The build writes ignored `frontend/dist/` assets. The existing FastAPI server
continues to serve the source assets; no hosting configuration is changed.
The Node tests exercise application functions with controlled network/DOM seams;
they supplement browser smoke tests, not replace them.

On Windows, install current root requirements before starting (including
`python-dotenv`, needed for `--env-file`). Copy `.env.example` to an untracked
`.env`, supply unique tenant tokens, and configure the applicable managers:
`PREP_CONFIG`/`PREP_STATE_DIR`, `PACK_CONFIG`/`PACK_STATE_DIR`,
`RETURNS_CONFIG`/`RETURNS_STATE_DIR`, `RECOVERY_CONFIG`/`RECOVERY_STATE_DIR`,
plus `RECEIVING_CAPTURE_REGISTRY` and Receiving's state/cache paths. Registration
files must reference actual trusted, hash-bound sources as specified in each
manager README. A provider key by itself does not configure a manager.
`--env-file .env` explicitly loads these settings; a bare Python import does not.

Orchestrator health now calls each manager's own health check in both execution
modes. Degraded configuration is visible before a workflow starts. These checks
do not invoke providers or establish model availability. Returns provider
selection and timeout settings belong in its registration JSON; see
[Returns provider configuration](agents/returns/PROVIDERS.md). No provider is
silently substituted when configuration or inference fails.

For the checked environment inventory, per-manager readiness, exact registration
interfaces and remaining live-demo prerequisites, see
[Configuration readiness](docs/CONFIGURATION-READINESS.md). The authenticated
offline API/persistence smoke test is
`python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_configured_console.py`.

Run an agent as its own service:

```sh
.venv/bin/uvicorn agents.prep.app:app --port 8102
curl localhost:8102/health          # then set "mode": "http" in agents/prep/agent.json
```

## Where participants put their agents

`agents/<stage>/` (`app.py` exposes `handle()`; `agent.json` describes your agent). Shared areas need Pod-level coordination: `orchestration/`, `shared/`, `tests/`, `docs/`. See [`PARTICIPANT-GUIDE.md`](PARTICIPANT-GUIDE.md).

## How the agents connect

Through the orchestrator only. It sends each agent an Agent Input (subject, this stage's captures, **all previous evidence**, overrides), validates and stores the Agent Output's evidence, updates workflow state, and decides what runs next. See [`INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md`](INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md).

## Required environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. **Never commit `.env`.**

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `ORCH_MODE` | Force `inproc` or `http` for all agents | each `agent.json` |
| `ORCH_FLOW` | Flow file for the API | the flow in `pod.json` |
| `<STAGE>_URL` | Where an `http`-mode agent listens (`PREP_URL`, …) | `agent.json` `url` |
| `OUT_DIR` | Where workflow state and evidence are written | `out` |
| `DATA_DIR`, `INPUT_DIR` | Sample CSVs for the stubs; your per-stage captures | `data/sample`, `data/input` |
| `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_FORMAT` | Logging | `WARNING`, `json` |
| Model provider keys | Whatever *your* agents use (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) | none |

## Example end-to-end workflow

`UNIT-0014` (FBA, returned). Full files in [`examples/end-to-end/`](examples/end-to-end/).

```text
Receiving  RCV-0014  accept          PASS   ─┐
Prep       PRP-0014  compliant       PASS    │  every record is stored and handed forward as previous_evidence
Pack       skipped (route = fba: Amazon packs it)
Returns    RTN-0014  liquidate       PASS   ─┤
Recovery   RCY-UNIT-0014  claim_recommended  FAIL ◀─┘
             • inbound_defect_fee  $2.00  CONTRADICTS  <- cites PRP-0014 (Prep says compliant)
             • weight-tier fee     $4.75  SILENT       <- no measured weight upstream; NOT claimed
Workflow status COMPLETED · Final outcome CLAIM_RECOMMENDED ($2.00, evidence attached)
```

(The stubs' claim rules are illustrative; your Recovery agent decides for real.) Also see [`examples/happy-path/`](examples/happy-path/), [`examples/uncertain-path/`](examples/uncertain-path/), [`examples/failure-path/`](examples/failure-path/).
